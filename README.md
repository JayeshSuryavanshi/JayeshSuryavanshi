A passionate Full Stack developer from Nashik, India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also a machine learning and open-source enthusiast. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
